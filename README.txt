           CS-101 Bubble Trouble Project

Features implemented:
1)Parabolic movement of bubbles.
2)Collision between bubbles and bullet(bullet too
  disappears after collision).

  In level 2: a)radius of bubbles is twice which splits
  into two bubbles of half radius when bullet hitS.
  b)bubbles move faster in x direction.
