# CS-101 Bubble Trouble Project

Features implemented:
<br />  1) Parabolic movement of bubbles.
<br />  2) Collision between bubbles and bullet(bullet too disappears after collision).
<br />  3) Collision between bubbles and shooter.
<br />  4) Introduced a score, time, level and health counter. Game gets over when we run out of time or health is over.
<br />  5) Implemented two levels in game.
<br />  In level 2: a) radius of bubbles is twice which splits into two bubbles of half radius when bullet hitS.
<br />              b) bubbles move faster in x direction.
<br />              c) health count does not renew after first level is over.
